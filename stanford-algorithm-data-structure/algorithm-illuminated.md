# Algorithm Illuminated

The algorithm illuminated book was used by for the [Stanford Algorithm Specialization]().

This specialisation comprises of various courses listed below :

- [Divide and Conquer, Sorting and Searching, and Randomized Algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-divide-conquer/home/welcome)
- [Graph Search, Shortest Paths, and Data Structures](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-graphs-data-structures)
- [Greedy Algorithms, Minimum Spanning Trees, and Dynamic Programming](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-greedy)
- [Shortest Paths Revisited, NP-Complete Problems and What To Do About Them](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-npcomplete)

These courses were taught by
