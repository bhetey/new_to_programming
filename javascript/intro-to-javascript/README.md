## Overview

- **What is JavaScript**
  This section contains the history of `javascript`. This is recommended to know the history of the language. Not just `javascript` but other languages as well.

- **Data Types & Variables**
  This section handles the different data types in `javascript` both _`primitive`_ and _`non primitive`_ data types. **Variables** was also discussed. i.e _what are variables, how do you use them, when do you use them_.

* **Conditionals**
  This section of the content describes `conditions` you should know in `javascript`. e.g `if else` condition.

- **Loops**
  Loops are very interesting to deal with in `javascript`. They give you the power to iteratively go over something again, again and again etc. you might know know of them already. For example is : `while`.

* **Functions**
  To be honest :) think of `function` as something you keep somewhere to automate tasks or anything you want it to do for you. Supposing you want to create a `timer`, to remind you to go for your lunch at a certain everyday ? With a `function` you can achieve that.

- **Array**
  Array is a very important tool in programming languagues generally. `Array` empowers programmers with the ability of keeping something for later use. You can add to it , remove from it, call what is inside it doesn't matter the postion. example is `[1,2,3,4]`.

* **Object**
  You must have heard about **_Object Oriented Programming_**. If that is not the case for you then, no worries :) it will be covered in this section. Let me give you a tiny example of how it works. Suppose you want when you click on a switch, you want it to turn yellow and white otherwise. Think of it like the bulb, with `object` you can achieve. Basic info you need about `object` will be covered here.
