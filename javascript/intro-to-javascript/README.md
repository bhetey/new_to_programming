- **Data Types & Variables**
  This section handles the different data types in `javascript` both _`primitive`_ and _`non primitive`_ data types. **Variables** was also discussed. i.e _what are variables, how do you use them, when do you use them_.

* **Conditionals**
  This section of the content describes `conditions` you should know in `javascript`. e.g `if else` condition.

- **Loops**
  Loops are very interesting to deal with in `javascript`. They give you the power to iteratively go over something again, again and again etc. you might know know of them already. For example is : `while`.

* **Functions**
  To be honest :) think of `function` as something you keep somewhere to automate tasks or anything you want it to do for you. Supposing you want to create a `timer`, to remind you to go for your lunch at a certain everyday ? With a `function` you can achieve that.
